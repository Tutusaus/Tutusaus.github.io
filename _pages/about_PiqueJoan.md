- **Introduction**: Joan Portí Piqué is a full professor at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, specializing in geometry, particularly in geometric structures in low-dimensional manifolds and geometric group theory. 
He earned his PhD in Mathematics from the Université Paul Sabatier in 1994 and has since contributed significantly to the field through various publications, including research on the geometrization of 3-dimensional orbifolds. 
Notably, he served as the senior thesis director for my academic project, where his guidance and expertise were invaluable. 
Additionally, he has received the Icrea Academia Prize and is actively involved in scientific advisory roles and editorial responsibilities.
