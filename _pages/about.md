Hey there! I’m <b>Guillem Tutusaus Alcaraz</b>, a mathematics graduate from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/study-plan/study-plan-and-timetables-1345467897115.html?param1=1216102918128). I grew up in [Terrassa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8egzKBS3s7TtUZq7), a homely city thirty minutes away from Barcelona.

I would consider myself an individual passionate about Science and Technology. From a young age I always wanted to understand how the planets moved around the sun and why is it that the underlying way to study this is by using calculus. Hence when I had the opportunity to study mathematics I didn't hesitate on accepting!

Besides my general coursework in <b>Mathematics</b>, throughout the years I've taken the initiative to self-study a significant portion of the <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Physics</b> curriculum. Also, I have experience in teaching most subjects at a Highschool level as well as advanced programming notions.

I enjoy tackling real-world challenges and have had the opportunity to participate in hackathons like [UABTheHack](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/guillemtutusausalcaraz_hackathon-uab-caixadenginyers-activity-7251669408786374658-Kcy6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and [HackUPC](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/guillemtutusausalcaraz_hackupc-ai-heuristicfunctions-activity-7193337563602993152-wrL3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), where I worked on problems ranging from optimization in AI algorithms to real-time route planning. My project work is diverse, from developing AI for decision-making using C and heuristic methods to building a low-cost weather balloon capable of recording atmospheric data. Many of these projects are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Tutusaus).

This is my [personal website](https://tutusaus.github.io/). By clicking on the different tabs above you’ll find a collection of my projects, reports, and anything that sparks my interest in math, engineering, and beyond.
