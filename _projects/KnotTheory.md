### **Introduction**
This [PDF](http://tutusaus.github.io/assets/pdf/KnotsandtheJonesPolynomial.pdf), titled *Nusos i el polinomi de Jones*, is part of my **Final Degree Thesis** which was done under the supervision of [Joan Porti PiquÃ©](https://tutusaus.github.io/people/). In it, I present an **introductory study on knot theory**, focusing on **algebraic invariants**, with a special emphasis on the **Jones polynomial**. I explore how knots can be classified, particularly for lower-order knots, and discuss some **applications of knot theory** in fields like **quantum computing and molecular biology**.  

My study begins with a historical overview of knots in human culture and mathematics, explaining their **topological properties** and key developments in the field. I then introduce fundamental **definitions and classifications** of knots, highlighting essential concepts such as **Reidemeister moves**, **knot invariants**, and the **Jones polynomial**. In the final sections, I delve into **applications**, demonstrating the real-world significance of knot theory.
